# emotion_detection_system
This Emotion Detection System uses deep learning techniques to classify emotions from images. The project evaluates four models—CNN, CNN with augmentation, VGG16, and ResNet50—to determine the most effective approach for emotion recognition. The final choice is ResNet50, which utilizes transfer learning for enhanced performance.
